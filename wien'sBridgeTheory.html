    <h2>Wien's Bridge</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <img class="first" src="img/WienBridge.jpeg" alt="WheatStone Bridge" width="350" height="280">
        <p class="theory ">The Wien's bridge is an ac electrical circuit widely used for measuring frequency and can also be used for the measurement of capacitance with high accuracy. The bridge can be used even at high voltages but the circuit is sensitive to frequency. The Wien bridge has a combination of R-C series in one arm and a parallel combination in another arm.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            The circuit consists of four arms, one arm with a series combination of resistor and capacitor and another with a parallel combination resistor and capacitor. The other two arms compress a resistance (as shown in the figure).</p>
            <p class="theory">
            A balance detector or null indicator is connected across two junctions (i.e., across BD as shown above). The indicator shows null deflection when the bridge is balanced i.e. when the junctions B and D will be at the same potential.

        <h3>Working Principle</h3>
        <p class="theory">Let Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4 be the impedances of the arm AB, AD, BC, and CD respectively and given as,

        <p class="theory">
            The above equation is used to determine the resistance ratio (R4/R3). Now equating the imaginary terms,

        <p class="theory">In order to maintain R1 = R2, a mechanical coupling is provided between them. So that R2 varies with R1 proportionally such that R1 = R2 can be maintained.

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory"><strong>Simple Circuitry:</strong>  Wien's bridge is formed using easily available electronic components namely resistors and capacitors.</li>
            <li class="theory"><strong>Cost-effective:</strong>  Since all the components used to design Wien's bridge are inexpensive, the cost of creating the circuit is meager for the manufacturers.</li>
            <li class="theory"><strong>Quantitative measurements:</strong> Wien's bridge has the capability to measure the frequency and capacitance of the circuit with high accuracy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory"><strong>Limited Frequency Generation:</strong> As Wien's bridge is very sensitive to large frequency values and the circuit may get destructed at high-frequency values, hence the frequency generated by the bridge is limited between 100 Hz and 100 kHz.</li>
            <li class="theory"><strong>High Output distortion:</strong> Due to the susceptibility of the Wien's bridge circuit to large frequency values, the resultant output signal is highly distorted.</li>
            <li class="theory"><strong>Not Purely Sinusoidal AC Input Voltage:</strong> Due to the presence of harmonic distortions at the input AC voltage source, the balance condition of the bridge is disrupted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p class="theory">The following are some applications of Wien's bridge circuit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory">Wien's bridge is used for the purpose of measuring the frequency of the input voltage and capacitance of the circuit.</li>
            <li class="theory">It is used for analyzing distortion due to harmonic disturbances.
                such as temperature, light, and strain.</li>
            <li class="theory">Wien's bridge also finds its application as a high-frequency oscillator.</li>
            <li class="theory">It is also used for estimating the frequency values in audio and radio oscillators.</li>
