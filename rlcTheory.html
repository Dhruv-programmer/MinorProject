    <h2>RLC Circuit</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <img class="first" src="img/rlcphoto.png" alt="WheatStone Bridge" width="300" height="280">
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p class="theory ">
            The RLC circuit is a fundamental building block of many electronic devices. It consists of the three
            elements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resistance R;</li>
            <li>Inductance L; and</li>
            <li>Capacitance C.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="theory">In its basic form, all three elements are connected in a series (as shown in figure).</p>
        <br>
        <h3>RLC circuit frequency</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            The resonant frequency of the RLC circuit is a natural frequency with which the current in the circuit
            changes in time. This natural frequency is determined by the capacitance C,and the inductance L.

            The resistance R is responsible for energy losses present in every real-world situation. If we try to push
            through the circuit a signal with a frequency different from the natural one, such a signal is damped.
            You can compute the resonant frequency of the RLC circuit with the following equation:</p>
        <p class="theory">
            <strong>f = 1 / [2π * √(L * C)]</strong>
            <br>
            where:
            <br>
            f : Resonant frequency;
            <br>
            L : Inductance of the inductor; and
            <br>
            C : Capacitance of the capacitor.
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Q-factor of the RLC circuit</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            The first characteristic number of the RLC circuit is the natural frequency. The second is the Q-factor.

            Q-factor determines how good the circuit is (how long the oscillations will last). If the Q-factor is less
            than 1/2, then the oscillations quickly die out.

            When designing the RLC circuit, we should aim at getting the Q-factor as large as possible. The formula for
            the Q-factor of the RLC circuit is:
<br>
<br>
<strong>

    Q = 1/R * √(L/C)
</strong>

           <br> where the new symbols are:
            <br>
            Q : Q-factor; and<br>
            R : Resistance.
        </p><h3>Applications</h3>
        <p class="theory">The RLC circuits have many applications. For example, you can encounter them in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory">
                Tuning circuits : known from analog radios;</li>
            <li class="theory">Filters : basic blocks of equalizers in music equipment can also be designed with a simpler RC circuit; and
                such as temperature, light, and strain.</li>
            <li class="theory">Oscillators circuits : converting DC signal to an AC signal, for example, in radio transmitters. </li>
        </ul>
