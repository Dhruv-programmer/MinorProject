    <h2>Wheatstone Bridge</h2>
    <div class="content">

        <p class="theory ">Wheatstone bridge, also known as the resistance bridge, calculates the unknown
            resistance
            by balancing two
            legs of the bridge circuit. One leg includes the component of unknown resistance.
            The Wheatstone Bridge Circuit comprises two known resistors, one unknown resistor and one variable
            resistor
            connected in the form of a bridge. This bridge is very reliable as it gives accurate measurements.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            A Wheatstone bridge circuit consists of four arms, of which two arms consist of known resistances while the
            other two arms consist of an unknown resistance and a variable resistance. The circuit also consists of a
            galvanometer and an electromotive force source. The emf source is attached between points a and b while the
            galvanometer is connected between points c and d. The current that flows through the galvanometer depends on
            its potential difference.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Working Principle</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            The Wheatstone bridge works on the principle of null deflection, i.e. the ratio of their resistances is
            equal, and no current flows through the circuit. Under normal conditions, the bridge is in an unbalanced
            condition where current flows through the galvanometer. The bridge is said to be balanced when no current
            flows through the galvanometer. This condition can be achieved by adjusting the known resistance and
            variable resistance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Applications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory">The Wheatstone bridge is used for the precise measurement of low resistance.</li>
            <li class="theory">Wheatstone bridge and an operational amplifier are used to measure physical parameters
                such as temperature, light, and strain.</li>
            <li class="theory">Quantities such as impedance, inductance, and capacitance can be measured using
                variations on the Wheatstone bridge. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="theory">For low resistance measurement, the resistance of the leads and contacts becomes significant and introduces an error.</li>
            <li class="theory">For high resistance measurement, the measurement presented by the bridge is so large that the galvanometer is insensitive to imbalance.</li>
            <li class="theory">The other drawback is the resistance change due to the currentâ€™s heating effect through the resistance. Excessive current may even cause a permanent change in the value of resistance.</li>
