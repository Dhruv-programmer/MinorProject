        <p class="theory ">An operational amplifier is an integrated circuit that can amplify weak electric signals.
            An operational amplifier has two input pins and one output pin. Its basic role is to amplify and output the
            voltage difference between the two input pins.
            Op amps usually have three terminals: two high-impedance inputs and a low-impedance output port. The
            inverting input is denoted with a minus (-) sign, and the non-inverting input uses a positive (+) sign.
            Operational amplifiers work to amplify the voltage differential between the inputs, which is useful for a
            variety of analog functions including signal chain, power, and control applications.

        <h3>Working Principle</h3>
        <p class="theory">
            an op-amp has a differential input and single ended output. So, if we apply two signals one at the inverting
            and another at the non-inverting terminal, an ideal op-amp will amplify the difference between the two
            applied input signals. We call this difference between two input signals as the differential input voltage.
            The equation below gives the output of an operational amplifier.Where, VOUT is the voltage at the output
            terminal of the op-amp. AOL is the open-loop gain for the given op-amp and is constant (ideally). For the IC
            741 AOL is 2 x 105.
            V1 is the voltage at the non-inverting terminal.
            V2 is the voltage at the inverting terminal.
            (V1 – V2) is the differential input voltage.
            It is clear from the above equation that the output will be non-zero if and only if the differential input
            voltage is non-zero (V1 and V2 are not equal), and will be zero if both V1 and V2 are equal. Note that this
            is an ideal condition, practically there are small imbalances in the op-amp. The open-loop gain of an op-amp
            is very high. Hence, an open loop operational amplifier amplifies a small applied differential input voltage
            to a huge value.
            Also, it is true that if we apply small differential input voltage, the operational amplifier amplifies it
            to a considerable value but this significant value at the output cannot go beyond the supply voltage of the
            op-amp. Hence it does not violate the law of conservation of energy.</p>
            <p class="theory">
            Closed Loop Operation

            The above-explained operation of the op-amp was for open-loop i.e. without a feedback. We introduce feedback
            in the closed loop configuration. This feedback path feeds the output signal to the input. Hence, at the
            inputs, two signals are simultaneously present. One of them is the original applied signal, and the other is
            the feedback signal. The equation below shows the output of a closed loop op-amp.Where VOUT is the voltage
            at the output terminal of the op-amp. ACL is the closed loop gain. The feedback circuit connected to the
            op-amp determines the closed loop gain ACL. VD = (V1 – V2) is the differential input voltage. We say the
            feedback as positive if the feedback path feeds the signal from the output terminal back to the
            non-inverting (+) terminal. Positive feedback is used in oscillators. The feedback is negative if the
            feedback path feeds the part of the signal from the output terminal back to the inverting (-) terminal. We
            use negative feedback to the op-amps used as amplifiers. Each type of feedback, negative or positive has its
            advantages and disadvantages.
                <br>
            Positive Feedback ⇒ Oscillator<br>
            Negative Feedback ⇒ Amplifier<br>
            Th above explanation is the most basic working principle of operational amplifiers.
